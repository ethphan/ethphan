### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a seasoned Frontend/Fullstack Engineer with a deep expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Node.js. With over 4 years of experience, I specialize in building intuitive and high-performance applications that deliver seamless user experiences.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, exploring the latest tech trends, and engaging with the developer community through conferences and meetups.
